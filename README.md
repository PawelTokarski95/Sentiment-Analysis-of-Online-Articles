# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Online-Articles-Python-

In this project, I am working on sentiment analysis of investment-related news, with a focus on different asset classes. The goal is to assess to what extent these assets carry a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, in percentage terms. I also decided to use Docker and then deploy the model to the cloud.

The model in this particular scenario is finBERT and data range is from month ago till today.
