# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Online-Articles-Python-

In this project, I am working on sentiment analysis of investment-related news, with a focus on different asset classes. The goal is to assess to what extent these assets carry a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, in percentage terms. I also decided to use Docker and then deploy the model to the cloud.

The model in this particular scenario is finBERT and data range is from month ago till today.

Here are some examples of the results:
